# My Personal Project

## TV Show and Movie Watchlist

### What this application does
This application allows users to **track all the TV shows and Movies they 
have watched or are planning to watch**. For each show they have watched, 
they will be able to record a rating out from 0 to 10, the genres, the director, 
number of episodes watched and a list of their favorite characters. Users will be able to view their list and see the 
details of each show.


### Who will use it
This app is directed towards individuals who are struggling to keep track of all
the movies and TV shows they have watched. With this app, users will be 
able to keep an organized list of what they have watched and help them 
remember which shows they found most enjoyable. Furthermore, users could 
share their list with friends to talk about and recommend some of their favorite
shows.

### Why this project is of interest to me
This project is of interest to me since I often struggle to remember all the 
shows I have watched and some of the characters that I liked. This 
application could help people, like myself, easily keep record of their 
favorite shows in an organized manner.
